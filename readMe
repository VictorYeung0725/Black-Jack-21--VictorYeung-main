Player can stop asking for cards. Whoever gets closest to 21, wins.

Remark
for logic

Remark
for process

1. try to use unicode to represent on the card object
2. try to use array for exercising the array method

reference unicode
const cardSet1 = {
A1: '&#127137',

};

// create ramdom number between 37-50 except 38

// generate random number
let range = Math.random();
// multiply with difference

// add with min value
